= Getting started with Ansible
[source: http://docs.ansible.com/]

== Overview
Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.

Ansibleâ€™s main goals are simplicity and ease-of-use. It manages machines over the SSH protocol.

== Installation

  [user@localhost ~]$ sudo yum install ansible

_Note: You may need to add epel repo or download the download the rpm from http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL[epel]_

++ Exchange SSH key

If you need to generate the ssh key:
  [user@localhost ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
  [user@localhost ~]$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@hostname

Store the key to avoid retyping password:
  [user@localhost ~]$ ssh-agent bash
  [user@localhost ~]$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa



=== Requirements
- *Host System*: Install Ansible [e.g. yum install ansible]
- *Gateway*: Download JBOSS Fuse 6.2.1 from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?product=jboss.fuse&downloadType=distributions[Red Hat Customer Portal] and save it in the Downloads folder

=== Step 1 - Prepare the system using Ansible

We'll use the automation tool Ansible to remotely provision our Gateway system by installing required components.

 * Open a terminal and enter the following commands:
  
  [user@localhost ~]$ git clone -b Virtual-Lab-1 https://github.com/IshuVerma/Virtual_IoT_Gateway.git
 
 * Update the host file [Virtual-IoT-Gateway/Ansible/host] with IP address of the Gateway and place the public key of the host on the remote Gateway (Ansible uses ssh to communicate with remote system)

_Note: For the Gateway, we're using username = 'demo-user' and password = 'change12_me'. Please update the playbook with the  username/password for your Gateway_
 
 * Launch the Ansible playbook by entering the following commands:
  
  [user@localhost ~]$ cd Virtual_IoT_Gateway/Ansible
  [user@localhost ~]$ ansible-playbook BuildGW
  
*Let the Ansible run through the tasks in the playbook. Once Ansible is finished, we're ready to start work directly on the Gateway*
